    "**We have been applying the Hypothesis testing technique in this part of the excercise. The hypothesis testing method is used in this case to identify whether a new feature in the website is going to have the expected outcome or not. We tested whether the new landing page has a better conversion rate than the old one. We used the null hypothesis assuming it is true in order to compare it to the observed value drawned from the data. In doing so, we obtain the p-value, the probability to obtain the observed statistic under the null hypothesis or one more extreme in favor of the alternative hypothesis. We compute the p-value by looking at more extreme values that could relate to the alternative hypothesis. Knowing the null hypothesis is that the new page conversion is equal or worse than the old page conversion, if the p-value is high, then there is high chances that the null hypothesis is True. So, our test bring us to the conclusion that the new page has a conversion equal or worse than the old page**"
